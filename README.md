# Crafting altar
This datapack adds a crafting station used by some of my other datapacks.

To create the altar:

* Place a lapis block in the middle with 4 deepslate brick stairs facing out from the lapis, and 4 candles at the sides of the stairs.
* Then throw 5 deepslate tiles, 10 diamonds, and 10 amathyst shards on the lapis block.

To use the altar:

* Throw the five outer items on the five pedestals.
* Then throw the middle item into the middle, this will start the altar.

Warnings:

* If any of the candles are broken, the altar gets destroyed, and currently doesn't give you anything back for it.
* If a recipe is wrong, it just eats your items. (this isn't gonna change)
